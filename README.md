### Project Description

Animal Buddy is an interactive database of animal(birds/insects/fish/animals) sightings. Users can upload their own pictures and descriptions of whatever animal they've seen. In addition, users can browse through other entries. The entries will be divided into specific categories based on the type of animal that was sighted. For each entry, users will be also able to add comments to other entries.

### How It Works

Animal Buddy uses a collection of technologies to allow the user to post and browse animal photos and locations in our database. After landing on our page, the user will be able to choose to either share a picture or discover some animals, or they can choose to browse a map of the area near their location for pictures and animals. The map is created by using HTML5's geolocation API, Leaflet, and Mapbox.
